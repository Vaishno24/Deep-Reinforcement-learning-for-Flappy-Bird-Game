Introduction - 

This project applies Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to develop an AI that can autonomously play the Flappy Bird game. By integrating deep learning with reinforcement learning, we tackle sequential decision-making problems, advancing the AI's capability in high-dimensional state spaces.

Objectives - 

To implement Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms for optimal policy learning.
Explore DQN and Double DQN (DDQN) models for enhancing game-playing performance.
Evaluate the models based on training time, iterations, and game scores.

Methodology - 

Utilized Python for implementing DRL algorithms.
Applied the Epsilon-Greedy algorithm for action selection, balancing exploration and exploitation.
Employed experience replay and target network techniques to stabilize learning.

Results - 

Achieved significant improvements in autonomous game-playing, with detailed metrics on training duration, iterations, and scoring efficiency.
Demonstrated the effectiveness of DRL models in game AI, with potential applications in more complex scenarios.
